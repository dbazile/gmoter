One day, [this](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/Emoji) will be
officially supported by Gnome.  Until then, just bind this to
a keyboard shortcut and carry on.

The only package dependencies are Python 2 and
[PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html),
both of which should be installed by default on Fedora and CentOS 7.
